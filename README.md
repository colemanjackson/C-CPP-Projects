Computer Science 229 Code


Written in my first project class: Advanced Programming Techniques. The code is a mess, but represents
my first real challange in writing 1000+ lines of code at any given time. These two projects are the SoundTools Project (pure C and the ncurses library),
and Conway's Game of Life, a C++ project (really more of a blend of C/C++, I wasn't pretty with my code). 

# Disclamer

All code is submitted as-is, for legacy's sake. Maybe one day I'll go through and update it, but not today. Laugh at how bad it is.

# Getting Started
to use, you will need :
g++/gcc compiler, this was meant to run in a linux enviroment. Google g++/gcc for installation instructions ( I believe ubuntu OS has it standard)


Once installed, the make files should build everything correctly. Simply navigate to the project directory and run the following command:
make all

this will build all executables, which can then be promted for help on how to use via ./executableName -h
